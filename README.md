# The Oblique Network
_Making Pixelmon Great Again since a year ago, give or take_

## The Server
Terra is one of the first of its kind: a Pixelmon adventure/survival hybrid. Featuring countless plugins like Quests, MMO-Pixelmon Skills, Trivia and Player-Gyms, it has always aimed higher. Through this wiki, we hope you will come to learn about more than the shiny plugins - you will learn about the continent's lore, the towns' history and the endless storylines that populate Oblique's Terra.

## FAQ
* Is there an enjin where I can find IPs, pictures, and latest news?
> No! And that's because we got something better. Enjin has historically bad displays and support, so we have taken this task onto ourselves and created [our own website](http://www.obliquemc.com/). The tracker has been redirected to [Github](https://github.com/ObliqueNET) (see below) and the Forums interactions are now through [Discord](https://discord.gg/B3XcYcR). It's better that way- it makes it easier to post memes.
* You said you don't believe in P2W... is there then no shop for Oblique?
> There is. EULA-compliant, our [webshop](http://www.obliquemc.com/store) is tailored to suit the sparkly, shiny and fabulous you. We have 4 permanent, paid ranks, and item bundles to pretty up your gameplay. Secure checkout is done through Buycraft. Start shopping [here](http://www.obliquemc.com/store).
* Where can I report an issue or suggest an improvement to the server?
> We would adore you till the end of time if you would write up a nice ticket on [our tracker](https://github.com/ObliqueNET/Terra/issues).
* Where would I find a Pixelmon guide? 
> The [PixelmonMod wiki](http://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) reigns supreme, and should always be used when you need to find Pokémon information.
* I still feel like a Charmander in the rain... lost and abandoned. Where do I get more help?
> The very best place to find help is to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/B3XcYcR), where there is always a staffer online willing to answer your help! All ranks have staffers positioned all over timezones, so you are sure to find someone.
